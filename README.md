Problem statement
Galas are the biggest parties of the year. Hosting firms of these events are well aware that everyone from around the world has their eyes on these nights. It can be for inspiration or for critique. It takes months of meticulous planning and delegation to host these events.

One such firm has decided to take a data-driven approach for planning their gala nights going forward. Aesthetics and entertainment are the most crucial segments of these events. So, this firm has hired you to help them aggregate and classify all images. These images are published by attendees and the paparazzi on various social media channels and other sources. You are required to build an image auto-tagging model to classify these images into separate categories. Data

This data set consists of the following two columns:

Image - Name of Image

Class - Category of Image ['Food', 'Attire', 'Decorationandsignage', 'misc']
